MushROMs->Controls->EditorForm.cs->CheckLunarDLL()
	Handle exceptions better. Like, see if it is under a different name, or inacessible file, etc.
	
Some parts of Lunar Compress may be non-functioning for C# (OpenRAMFile), so test it out soon, or find a workaround.

MushROMs->SMB1->PaletteEditor->Open/SaveAs()
	Does not support different file extensions. Fix when possible.

MushROMs->SMB1->GFXEditor.cs
	Undo functions mess up when drawing multiple pixels. A fix for this would be nice
